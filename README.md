Java translation of Programs from The Algorithm Design Manual (2nd Edition)

Original C code ported from https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/algorist/book/programs/

Features:
1. Translated original C programs in procedural language style into Object Oriented fashion.
2. Converted original test cases, included in test-script, into set of Java unit test cases.
3. Implemented generic Graph data structure to cover unweighted, weights, flow graph instances. Removed code duplication in original C implementation.
